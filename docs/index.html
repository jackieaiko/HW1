        <h1>This is my hw 1 submission</h1>
        <p>I hope to gain <em>new skills</em> on creating websites from this course and 
            plan to use these skills in my future projects and perhaps career. 
            I would like to know more about both the <em><strong>internal</strong></em> and <strong>external</strong> process 
            of website making and look forward to learning it.
